# Description
Kyohop is a first-person 3D platformer where players must navigate a mysterious facility and find their way to freedom. Designed for my first game jam, Kyohop currently features two levels, each requiring the player to reach a portal to progress to the next stage. The game emphasizes precision and timing offering platforming in a compact, engaging experience.
